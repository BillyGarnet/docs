## Overview

Dark's alpha package manager allows re-using Dark functions from other users or canvases. Today, only Dark employees can add functions to the package manager. Packages are named by the creator, package, function, and version and are accessible via autocomplete. The package manager today is intended for connections to third party services and APIs.

In the future, packages will be imported vs. being continually accessible, and community members will be able to contribute directly. If you would like to request or contribute a package today, please reach out via Slack.

## Slack Package

The first package in the Dark package ecosystem is for the Slack API. For a full list of Slack functions, click [here](slack-apps/slack-packages).

## Upcoming Packages

We have some ideas of packages we intend to implement, but would love to hear what would be most useful.

## Contributions

If you'd like to share a function to the community, please send us a link to the function and we will set it up to be shared back! We love contributions for third party APIs.
